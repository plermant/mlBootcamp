Mostly interested in the Modeling-Focused track

Since I'm currently working at PayPal, I would consider a project revolving around either fraud detection or loan approval decision.
Another area of interest is medical diagnostic based on images (e.g. X-rays of MRI)
Of particualr interest is feature engineering, whereby we modify/shrink the incoming dataset for /
faster processing while preserving its value (scope, accuracy etc ...). I also like the idea of model parameter tuning and model mixing/combining
This being said, this is a new field so I don't even know yet what i'll enjoy the most after i'm done!
